Plastic or synthetic rubber condoms can beused if you have a latex allergy, but they break more easily than latex condoms. Naturalmembrane condoms, like lambskin, should not be used to prevent HIV.</dl><dt>2]Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP):</dt><dl>PrEP is a prescription medication that can greatly reduce the risk of HIV. Side effects mayinclude nausea, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, or stomach pain, but they are usually not seriousand go away over time.</dl><dt>3]Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): </dt><dl>PEP is a medication that can prevent HIV after a possible exposure. You must take PEPevery day for 28 days, and you will need to return to your health care provider for follow-uptesting.</dl><dt>4]Abstinence:</dt><dl>Abstaining from sex is one way to prevent HIV.</dl><dt>5]Avoid sharing needles: </dt><dl>Never share needles or other drug injection equipment.</dl><dt>6]Get tested: </dt><dl>Get tested for HIV every three to six months. You can buy a self-test kit at a drugstore oronline.</dl><dt>7]Get tested and treated for STDs: </dt><dl>Having another STD can increase the chance of getting HIV.</dl><dt>8]Male circumcision:</dt><dl>In high-burden countries in eastern and southern Africa, male circumcision is recommended.</dl><dt>9]Use lube: </dt><dl>Applying lube can help minimize friction and reduce the risk of a condom breaking or slidingoff.</dl><br><br><h2> <p >As per regulated by the Indian Government for the well being if the country and itspeople</p></h2><h2>Jai Hi<b2>nd!Jai </b2><b2>Bharat!</h2></body></html>
